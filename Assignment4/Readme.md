# OVERVIEW 
In this assignment we will be implementing a algorithm "Deep Support Vector Data Description for Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection" , on a dataset as mentioned in the research paper - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333642118_Deep_Support_Vector_Data_Description_for_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Anomaly_Detection
We will be doing Anomaly detection for classes {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and results are shown below .

# INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Upload SS_DSVDD.ipynb on Google Collab.
2. Mount and save the dataset (We have used MNIST DATASET, mentioned in the paper ) in you drive.
3. Run the code blocks.


# Results:
ROC SCORED FOR EACH CLASS : 

Outliers V/S inliers Graph for each class {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}: 

So, The Deep Support Vector Data Description for svdd is showing good results.
