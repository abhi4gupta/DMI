# OVERVIEW 
In this assignment we will be implementing a algorithm "DEEP SVDD" , on a dataset as mentioned in the research paper - http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ruff18a.html. 
We will be doing Anomaly detection for classes {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and results are shown below .

# INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Upload deepSVDD_oneClassClassification.ipynb on Google Collab.
2. Mount and save the dataset (We have used MNIST DATASET, mentioned in the paper ) in you drive.
3. Run the code blocks.


# Results:
ROC SCORED FOR EACH CLASS :

So, The One-Class Deep SVDD is showing good results.
